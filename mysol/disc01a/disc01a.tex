		\item[(a)] 
		Prove by contraposition.n is even.Then, by definition $n=2k$.Because, $n^2=4k^2=2(2k^2)$, and $k \in Z$, so $n^2$ is even
		\item[(b)] assume that $n^2$ is odd, by definition for some integer l $n = 2l + 1$, then $8k + 1 = 2(4k) + 1$, since $4k$ is an integer, thus $n^2$ can be written in the form $8k + 1$ for some integer k

	\section{Pebbles}
		Prove by contradiction.Assume that there does not exist an all-red column.Then every column has a blue pebble.So there must exist a way that can choose one pebble from each column but all pebbles are blue.This cause a contradiction.Thus original proposition is right.
